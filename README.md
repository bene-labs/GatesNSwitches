GatesNSwitches is a sandbox game that lets you make use of the logic gates that power every computer at its core.

Each gate has inputs and outputs which can only have one of three states: on/true (blue), off/false (grey) or undefined (red) when the value is unknown.

Explore, experiment and experience what's possible with nothing but rudimentary binary logic as you build your own contraptions.
